  <h1>A Wonderfully Engaging Profile About Me</h1>
  <h4>Author: Jesse Kokanovic, s3807331, s3807331@student.rmit.edu.au</h4>
  <HR>
  <h2>A Little Introduction...</h2>
    <img src="myface.jpg" width="234" height="312">
    <p>Hi, my name is Jesse and I am 20 years old living in Townsville North Queensland. I have previously studied electrical engineering with a software minor at James Cook University.
    I completed two and a half years of the degree with my biggest interests being in programming and embedded systems before deciding to switch into IT.
    I enjoy playing basketball and have represented Queensland for it at a state level. A fun fact about myself is that I’m 6’7, and still only the third tallest in my family.</p>
  <h2> My Interest in IT:</h2>
    <h3><i>What is my interest? How did it start?</i></h3>
    <p>My interest in IT stems heavily from my time in Highschool. From grades 9 – 12 I took an IT class every year, with the Junior school subjects focusing on very general subjects, like what a computer system is, while the senior subjects went more in depth with these topics and introduced programming. My teacher during senior school, Mr Villalba, was instrumental in sparking my interest in IT. Our classes were always on the last period of Friday afternoons, but he always made me look forward to them because of his passion for the subject. He also encouraged me to participate in design sprints and programming competitions which helped me practice performing under time constraints. Other than studying IT at school, I have also worked at a primary school as the on-site support technician. The job involved supervising and maintaining IT assets, providing support to staff and students, and upkeep of school servers and networking.  Outside of school, I have played around with Arduino boards; one of my projects being a ‘smart’ mirror that displayed weather and calendar information. I have also built my own and several friend’s computers. I love programming and the Internet of Things. I find devices that embed into our lives to make them easier really interesting, and am looking foward to see what cool gadgets we have in 10 years time. </p>
    <h3><i>Why did I choose RMIT?</i></h3>
    <p>I have previously completed 7 semesters of internal studies at James Cook University and was initially looking to continue internal studies in Melbourne once I had moved down. However, my plans to move had to be delayed, and so I had to readjust. Rather than miss a semester of university, I decided to study externally with the plan to change to internal once I was able to move. RMIT seemed like the best fit, as the external mode seemed to be very accommodating with the availability of content and a big focus on interaction between other students and lecturers/tutors. In terms of future thinking, the city campus is also in an ideal spot for me once I can study internally. </p>
    <h3><i>What do I expect to learn from my studies?</i></h3>
    <p>In terms of technical skills, I expect I will learn a lot about computer and networking systems, databases and programming. I also imagine I’ll learn about security and data privacy considering the prevalence of issues regarding these topics in today’s age. In terms of soft skills, I expect to learn a lot about team work and project management strategies, including how to contribute positively to large projects or teams and present ideas effectively. I also expect there will be a focus on communication skills, both orally and through other means. </p>

      <h3><i>Why this job?</i></h3>
        <p>This position involves managing a team of engineers on major projects, including recruitment, goal setting and strategy development. There is also a large technical component involved in my own software development, and also the oversight of the team’s development. This is appealing to me as I enjoy working through projects, especially on the management side. The technical component and developing code for a variety of different applications is also very appealing as I love technical challenges and problem solving. </p>
          <p><b>The qualifications required for this position are:</b></P>
          <ul>
            <li>Bachelor’s Degree or equivelent</li>
            <li>10 years of software engineering experience</li>
            <li>5 years experience as technical lead</li>

    <h2>My Personal Profile:</h2>
      <h3><i>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</i></h3>
        <img src="mbti.png" height="300">
      <h3><i>DISC Test:</i></h3>
        <img src="disc.png" height="300">
      <h3><i>Learning Type:</i></h3>
        <p> My learning type was determined to be <b>Auditory/Visual.</b></p>
      <h3><i>What does this mean for me?</i></h3>
      <p>My Myers-Briggs type was determined to be ENFP – Extroverted, intuitve, feeling, and prospecting. This means that I enjoy making social and emotional connections with others, I am independent, and have a tendency to fulfill a leadership role. It also means that I stress easily, and can lose focus if the task at hand isn’t interesting to me. My learning type was determined as an auditory/visual learner. This means I learn best by hearing and listening, while being assisted by readings or a visual aide. When learning new things, its important that I not only just see things, I also need to hear the content. The DISC test which assesses behaviour around 4 central traits: dominance, influence, steadiness, and compliance. My DISC test results returned pretty evenly spread, with the largest percentage in steadiness and the lowest percentage in compliance. This means I am a clear thinker, and like to be objective and analytical. I am also supposedly good at handling challenging technical assignements, and work well under pressure. I have strong motivations to set and attain personal goals. <br><br> In a team setting, this might influence me to take on the role of an organiser, as my personality type tends to allow me to make connections with others and assume a natural leadership role. The majority result of steadiness from the DISC test also lends itself towards this role as I work well under presssure, and set realistic but still functional goals. When joining a team I should consider working with people that are good at staying on task, and that a creative brainstormers, as this is where my weaknesses supposedly are. We having team discussions I should also make sure that we have clear spoken communications, a recored is taken of the meeting, and that any ideas presented are done so visually (mind maps etc) as this is how I retain information best.</p>

    <h2>Project:</h2>
      <h3><i>Overview:</i></h3>
        <p>Diabetes is a term used to describe a group of conditions that affect the way in which the human body manages the amount of sugar in the blood. People with the condition cannot maintain a healthy level of glucose in their blood, as their bodies do not produce sufficient amounts of insulin – a hormone responsible for the conversion of glucose into energy. As such, their blood sugar levels must be monitored. This project offers a hardware solution for monitoring blood sugar through the use of a non-invasive wristband, backed by software in the form of a mobile app that connects to the monitor, and provides the user with updates relating to insulin intake, blood sugar levels, and food/carb intake. </p>
      <h3><i>Motivation:</i></h3>
        <p>The prevalence of diabetes throughout the Australian (and worldwide population) is only increasing. Specifically, Type 2 diabetes, a proven consequence of obesity, will continue to increase in commonness as the average life becomes more sedentary and our diets become higher in sugar and caloric content (Diabetes Australia, 2015). Though the effects of diabetes can be extremely harmful, it is also a manageable condition. Through the injection of insulin to lower blood sugar, and the application of a controlled diet to increase blood sugar, people can enjoy a life free from the effects of diabetes. There already exists monitors and apps to help with these processes, but through separate applications. Creating a hardware solution with software integration that not only tracks blood sugar non-invasively, but also tracks food and carb intake should provide a more convenient and reliable way to manage diabetes. </P>
      <h3><i>Description:</i></h3>
        <p>The implementation of this project has two main components: a blood sugar monitor and a mobile phone app that connect via Bluetooth. These two will work together to get accurate data from the user’s body, and then represent and transform this data in a useful manner. The direct coordination between the monitor and the app should ideally provide a more convenient way of managing diabetes for both the people with the condition, and their medical practitioners. </p>
        <h4><i>The hardware monitor:</i></h4>
          <p>The monitor ideally would be designed in a similar vein to popular fitness trackers made by companies such as Fitbit or Gamin. A wearable to be worn like a watch, with a smaller profile so that it doesn’t draw attention. The main functionality of the blood sugar monitor is as follows:<br><b>1. Read blood-sugar level non-invasively</b><br>Current blood sugar monitors require the user to prick their finger to draw blood and wiped on a small strip of paper. This is inserted into the meter, and the blood sugar calculated in millimoles per litre (mmol/L). Based off this measurement, the amount of insulin the person is required to take is calculated using a ratio provided by a medical professional and is reported back to the user. Instead of using blood, the device will have optical sensors that use infrared light to determine the blood sugar level (Laska, 2019), removing the need to draw blood and saving costs by removing one-time use materials.<br><b>2. Record blood-sugar level every fifteen minutes</b><br>Rather than requiring the person to actively record their blood sugar, the device will record a reading every 15 minutes. This will be done passively and requires no input from the user. Each recording is saved to the accompanying app.<br><b>3. Vibrate to notify wearer when glucose levels are too high or too low</b><br>The end result of monitoring the blood sugar level of a person is to make them aware when it is reaching unsafe levels, whether that be too high or too low. When the person approaches either extreme, the include vibration motor in the device provides haptic feedback – one long vibration for too high, two short vibrations for too low.<br><b>4. 7 Day battery life with fast charging speeds</b><br>The device’s battery must be long enough to last a full week and be easily rechargeable through USB-C standard, so as to minimise time off the wrist. Ideally, is should also be easily maintainable or repaired so to make troubleshooting easier. </p>
        <h4><i>The Mobile Application:</i></h4>
          <p>The accompanying app needs to be designed simply enough to be usable for all ages and be developed for both Android and IOS platforms. The core functions of the app are:<br>
          <b>1. Record blood sugar readings from the wearable</b><br>Every 15 minutes, the wearable will send a reading to the phone which is recorded in the app. This data is accessible by the user and presented in a graph that shows blood-sugar (mmol/L) over time (hours) for the current day. If the limits of blood sugar are reached, the application calculates how much insulin is required using the pre-set ratio supplied by a medical practitioner, and records how much was taken at the time.
          <br>
          <b>2. Allow the user to record dietary information</b><br>An important part of managing diabetes is controlling your diet. The application will allow the user to input the food they have eaten throughout the day and will allow for input of how many grams of carbs are consumed as well. A section to allow the user to leave comments will also be included and the entered information will be timestamped throughout the day.
          <br>
          <b>3. Allow weekly and monthly reports to be printed</b><br>The app will also be able to print either a monthly or weekly report, summarising the blood sugar level, amount of insulin taken, and amount of carbs eaten over each day throughout the period (including user comments). This should be helpful to provide to doctors when they need to analyse how the user’s management is proceeding.
          </p>
        <h3><i>Tools, Technologies and Skills:</i></h3>
          <p>The biggest focus in this project is the development of optical blood sugar monitors. This will need to be done to a standard that is medically accurate and is small enough to sit in a footprint similar to that of a wristwatch. Experience in developing optical sensors in the medical space will be ideal for this project, as will skill in manufacturing small electronics that are reliable and maintainable. In terms of the application, the software can be written in whatever language is convenient, such as languages like Java for Android, or Swift for IOS devices. A point of importance is the stability of the application, as people will rely on it for medical advice. </P>
        <h3><i>Outcome:</i></h3>
          <p>The overall goal of this project is to make the management of diabetes more convenient for people that have the condition. By streamlining and creating a more cohesive experience that tracks not just blood sugar levels, but also dietary and insulin intake – and does so through a non-invasive, passive means – the active participance of managing diabetes should be reduced, relieving stress. As diabetes becomes more prevalent, its important to refine the ways we manage it. This project should not only achieve that, but also open the door way in terms of wearable technology that can be made useful in monitoring a person’s everyday health.</p>
